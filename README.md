## What?
This is a store.
It's just a javscript object, with no methods, and a bunch of helper functions.


It's designed to be extremely simple, to the point of being useless as
and actual piece of production software.

## Why?
I needed something extremely simple to turn into an exercise, so that i could quickly practise writing tests.

The point of it's simplicity is so that i could write tests for the code that extends it, whilst already having something a little dymanic to play with.
